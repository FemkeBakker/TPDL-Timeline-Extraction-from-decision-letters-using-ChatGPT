# Timeline-Extraction-from-decision-letters-using-ChatGPT
This repository contains code for extracting timeline from government decision letters using ChatGPT. 

In this read me you can find the following things:
1. Overview of a timeline example
2. Instruction for the demo
3. Explanation of the content of the different files

### Demo of timeline example
We have marked the annotations of one of the documents in a [PDF](https://github.com/FemkeBakker/Timeline-Extraction-from-decision-letters-using-ChatGPT/blob/main/voorbeeld_pdf.pdf) to demonstrated how the annotations look. In [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/FemkeBakker/Timeline-Extraction-from-decision-letters-using-ChatGPT/blob/main/demo.ipynb) we have set up a demonstration, where the notebook takes a document and returns an ordered dataframe as the timeline. As default, we have set up the same document as from the PDF example, however feel free to insert another file as input. More instructions about the demo can be found in demo.ipynb. Below, an image of the timeline we would like the algorithm to return of the document:
