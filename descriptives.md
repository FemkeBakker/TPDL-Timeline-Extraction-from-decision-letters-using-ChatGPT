# Descriptives
Here we show descriptives of the test set, which contains 50 documents. In figure 1 the distribution of the classes can be seen. Furthermore, Figure 2 contains the distribution of token length of the sentences. What we can see in Fig. 1 is that all documents have a "decision made" date, but not a "request made" date. This because there are documents which only state the "request received" date. Furthermore, in Fig. 2 we can see that the token length of the sentences can differ a lot.
